🧠 How It Works

1️⃣ Data Collection
The system uses tools like snscrape or APIs to collect posts that mention a brand name or hashtag (e.g., “#Nike” or “Apple”).

2️⃣ Text Preprocessing
Removes URLs, stopwords, and special characters, and converts text to lowercase.

3️⃣ Sentiment Analysis
Classifies each post as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using NLP models (TextBlob, VADER, or BERT).

4️⃣ Trend Detection
Identifies most frequent hashtags, keywords, and topics over time.

5️⃣ Visualization
Displays insights as pie charts, bar graphs, and time-series sentiment trends.
