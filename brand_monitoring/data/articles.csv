Amid the blizzard of nocturnal numbers any by-election generates, three stand out in Caerphilly this morning. Labour, so long the victor of so many a south Wales political contest, humbled, pummelled, crushed - attracting just 11% of voters. The Conservatives, so often the victor of many a UK-wide election - 2%. Yes, you read that right - the two big beasts of Westminster politics managed just 13% of the vote between them. Just one in seven voters backed either Labour or the Conservatives, which is extraordinary. This contest, for weeks, was instead a race between an outfit, Reform UK, which barely existed a few years back and another, Plaid Cymru - until now the perpetual bridesmaid in contests in Caerphilly. Between them, Plaid and Reform attracted 83% of the vote – and Plaid beat Nigel Farage's party easily.

As so often in election contests, there is a striking human story that illustrates the wider picture. Today's victor, Lindsay Whittle, a Plaid Cymru councillor for nearly half a century, told me he remembers standing in the crowds in Caerphilly in 1968 as a 15-year-old new recruit to the party. The party, then, came pretty close to toppling Labour in a Westminster by election. But here is the thing: they didn't, they were second. Defeat at Labour's hands was something Whittle was to get very used to - he has stood for election to Westminster ten times, and stood repeatedly for election to Cardiff Bay too. He had always lost - until now. Now in his 70s, he tastes victory for the first time. Speaking to senior Plaid figures, they detect - and have for some time - a sense that the tide may finally be going out for Labour in Wales. They are determined to capitalise and allow themselves to dream of governing Wales, at least as the main party, after next May's Senedd elections across the nation.

PA Media The Caerphilly contest was, for weeks, a race between Reform UK and Plaid Cymru

So, what next for Reform? A solid second place with 36% of the vote, is a solid performance for an upstart, but insurgencies remain insurgent by winning – and they were easily beaten. It is clearly not easy for them to be the first choice ""none of the above"" alternative to Labour and the Conservatives when there is another party also claiming that mantle. That is a challenge for them in Wales, as it is in Scotland with the SNP, in a way that it isn't in England. And then there are the consequences for Labour. Labour's heritage in these parts includes some of the most consequential names in its long history: founding father Keir Hardie, NHS founder Nye Bevan, former leaders Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock. This morning, the prospect for Labour of heavy defeat across Wales next May - ending 27 years of continuous devolved power - looks more likely than ever. And the questions for the Prime Minister pile up higher."

BBC Sophie says obsessive compulsive disorder is still misunderstood

The number of 16-24 year olds in England reporting symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder, or OCD, has more than tripled in a decade, BBC analysis of NHS data has found. The condition is now the second-most widespread mental health disorder for young adults, according to statistics from a major NHS England survey. ""OCD, I like to think of it as a bully, it attacks everything, everything you care about, everything you love,"" says Sophie Ashcroft. ""A lot of people do associate OCD with cleanliness, and being clean, and getting all your socks in a certain order. It's so much more than that."" The 22-year-old is one of a number of young people and their families to have contacted us through Your Voice, Your BBC News explaining how they can't access NHS treatment for their symptoms. Those who could get seen spoke of a shortage of expert staff and effective treatments. The average referral time figure for young people to be seen at a national OCD centre in London was 41 weeks last year, nearly three times as long as it was five years previously. The government told us it was ""turning services around"", hiring 8,500 extra mental health workers, delivering more talking therapies and providing better access to help through the NHS App. It also said it was expanding the rollout of mental health support teams in schools. Sophie sometimes struggles to leave her home because she feels compelled to repeat small tasks - such as getting into the shower or cleaning her teeth - to dispel intrusive or distressing thoughts. ""If I had a bad thought during the day, it would ruin the rest of my day. I'd think something bad was gonna happen,"" she tells us.

'Behind closed doors it's sheer panic'

The people who have contacted BBC News say lives have been devastated, with some families who haven't been able to get NHS help telling us they have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on private care. Charities insist there is an OCD crisis and say the figures should be a wake-up call for the government. OCD symptoms can affect adults and children, and can begin as early as six years old - but they are often triggered during puberty and early adulthood. Sophie's symptoms first appeared when she was aged nine, she says, but it was a decade later, when a close friend died, that things became a lot worse. To dispel troubling thoughts, she says it led her to repeat actions again and again - things most people would consider mundane and would do without a second thought. ""It's something telling me you have to do that again, you have to hug that person again, and it just takes over,"" says Sophie. ""It's such an awful, awful feeling."" Despite all this, Sophie has just finished drama school. ""I'm really, really good at hiding it, but behind closed doors it's sheer panic,"" she explains.

Getty Images OCD is so much more than being fixated on cleanliness, says Sophie

About 370,000 young people in England reported OCD symptoms in the financial year 2023/24, our analysis of the latest NHS Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (June 2025) has found. That is more than three times the number from 2014, when the figure stood at around 113,000. It means OCD is now second in the list of named mental health disorders - placing it and other anxiety disorders well ahead of depression:

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) 7.6% Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) 5.7% Phobias 4.8% Depressive episodes 3.8 %

Why is OCD on the rise among young people?

Improved awareness of the condition has likely contributed to people seeking help, say experts - but, according to charities and many of those with OCD, societal problems, combined with the pressure of social media, are the main driver for the reported rise. Leigh Wallbank, chief executive of charity OCD Action, describes many young people's lives as a ""pressure pot"". ""They're facing financial issues, educational issues, global issues - the environment is such a big issue,"" she tells us. ""I think of them living in this pressure pot, and then underneath that, giving heat to this pressure pot, is social media."" The Covid-19 pandemic also played a part, says Minesh Patel, associate director of policy and influencing at the mental health charity, Mind. The pandemic put a ""particular and unique strain"" on people with OCD, with disruption to routine, an inversion of social norms and a hyperfocus on hygiene, he says. ""Barriers to social interaction, including treatment and support services, meant that many coping mechanisms were disrupted or unavailable for an extended period of time,"" he adds. NHS help for OCD patients includes specialist talking therapy called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) - which can include Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). Through ERP patients are helped to manage their anxiety by gradually being exposed to their fears, while preventing them from performing their usual compulsive behaviours. Medication is also offered - usually a type of antidepressant.

Getty Images The NHS is blind to the real scale of obsessive compulsive disorder, says Leigh Wallbank from OCD Action

But not everyone can access these treatments. Sophie was told by her GP that it is likely she does have OCD - but, two years on, she still hasn't received an appointment to see a specialist for a formal diagnosis. In the meantime, her GP has referred her for a limited course of CBT which comes to an end soon. Sophie says she is ""absolutely petrified"" of what the future holds. Leigh Wallbank from OCD Action is critical of the government for failing to collect regular quarterly data on obsessive compulsive disorder, and outcomes for patients who have it, as it does for many other conditions. Without data, says the charity, the NHS is blind to the real scale of OCD, the success of treatments and who is being left behind. We asked health officials in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland if they knew the number of young people with OCD symptoms, but they all said they do not collect that information.

'The system could not, or would not, provide help'

A mum from the south of England, who wants to remain anonymous, told us her autistic daughter first showed signs of OCD when she was 10 years old. Her daughter is now 17 and the OCD is severe, she says. ""My daughter has gone from being a scholarship-winning student, to being sectioned multiple times."" Some specialist treatment has been offered to the teenager, but her mum tells us her daughter is often too unwell to leave the house to attend appointments, or even take her medication. ""The impact on [all] our children, and us, is devastating. Our lives have been decimated not just by the illness, but by a system that could not, or would not, provide the help she needed, when she needed it."" The mother says the UK is failing in its treatment of young people with severe OCD. There are not enough specialists, beds or treatment options, she believes. Children and adolescents with OCD across England can receive treatment at a national centre at the Maudsley Hospital in London. However, the average wait time for a referral to the service rose from 15 weeks in 2020, to 41 weeks in 2024, according to a response to the BBC's Freedom of Information Act request. But the hospital trust says that wait time is being cut. Ade Odunlade, chief operating officer for South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust said: ""We have worked incredibly hard to reduce delays and have lowered the average wait for assessments to around 20 weeks. ""We empathise with anyone who has had to wait for their assessment as we know how difficult that is."" The trust says it has now been able to secure additional funding which will allow them to employ further staff and drive down the waiting list even further. It expects an approximate wait for assessment of about 12-16 weeks by early Spring 2026, it told us.

Marie Fuller Marie and Graham Fuller felt they had no choice but to pay for OCD treatment abroad for their daughter

But even when people can access all the available help, it is sometimes not enough. Graham and Marie Fuller, from Norwich, contacted the BBC to say their daughter had been hospitalised with OCD aged 12. They described a revolving-door pattern of going backwards and forwards between NHS services for different treatments, with their daughter improving and then repeatedly relapsing. After years of their daughter struggling with the condition, the family then decided to go to Texas to try a rare and radical procedure. Their daughter, who is now 20, underwent deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery - where electrodes are implanted in the brain to deliver electrical impulses to help manage OCD symptoms. The treatment is approved by US regulators, but in the UK the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says DBS can only be used for research studies, because there is not enough evidence on how safe or effective the practice is for OCD. Having a loved one with OCD ""has taken its toll on all of us, but we had to do all we could to help"", says Marie, explaining how, before undergoing DBS, her daughter had discussed going to Switzerland to end her life. Marie says her daughter is now back at university, though she concedes it is still early days in terms of the success of the treatment."

US President Donald Trump has announced an immediate end to all trade negotiations with Canada over an advert critical of the tariffs he has imposed on the nation. The advert, sponsored by the government of Canada's province of Ontario, quoted Trump's predecessor, Ronald Reagan, an icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs ""hurt every American"". Trump wrote on social media that the advert was ""FAKE"" and ""egregious"", adding that trade talks were ""HEREBY TERMINATED"". His administration has imposed a 35% levy on many Canadian imports, as well as individual tariffs targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing. Ontario has been particularly hard-hit by these.

Trump has allowed exemptions for goods that fall under a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that he negotiated during his first term. But Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has since his election earlier this year attempted to strike a deal that would ease the US tariffs. This has been complicated by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who is one of the most vocal critics of the taxes levied on US firms buying Canadian products. In the minute-long advert published last week, Reagan's voice can be heard narrating over images that include the New York Stock Exchange and cranes adorned with both US and Canadian flags. The video excerpts a 1987 national radio address by Reagan that focused on foreign trade. ""When someone says 'let's impose tariffs on foreign imports', it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while it works, but only for a short time,"" Reagan says in the advert. ""But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer. ""High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars... Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs."" The Ronald Reagan Foundation - which is charged with preserving his legacy - released a statement on Thursday saying the advert had used ""selective"" audio and video of the former president's remarks. It said the advert ""misrepresents"" the former president's address, without specifying why, and accused the Ontario government of not seeking permission to use and edit the remarks. The foundation said it was ""reviewing its legal options"". Trump referenced this statement, and said the video was designed to ""interfere with"" the US Supreme Court's upcoming decision in November on whether Washington's sweeping tariffs on many nations' products are legal. The court's decision represents the biggest test of Trump's presidential authority and signature economic policy, potentially forcing the US to refund billions collected in tariffs.

While the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words. The order in which he makes the comments has been changed. The advert's penultimate sentence is taken from near the beginning of his speech, and a phrase that features about halfway through the advert is likewise taken from an earlier point in the address. The original address - titled Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade - is regarding a specific set of tariffs the Reagan administration had at the time imposed on some Japanese goods. Reagan seeks to use the speech explain why he had introduced the tariffs in this ""special case"" despite his belief that ""imposing such tariffs or trade barriers and restrictions of any kind are steps that I am loath to take"". He makes clear that he wants to lift them as soon as possible ""to promote the prosperity and economic development that only free trade can bring"" - a position he stresses throughout the speech.

AFP The bodies of the dead Palestinians were transferred by the Red Cross in refrigerated lorries

Out of a single room, with no DNA testing facilities or cold storage units of its own, the forensics team at Gaza's Nasser hospital face the challenges brought by peace. Over the past eleven days, 195 bodies have been returned to Gaza by Israeli authorities, in exchange for the bodies of 13 Israeli hostages, under the terms of Donald Trump's ceasefire deal. Photographs released by Gaza's medical authorities show some of the bodies badly decomposed, and arriving in civilian clothes or naked except for underwear, some with multiple signs of injury. Many have their wrists tied behind their backs, and doctors say some bodies arrived blindfolded or with cloth roped around their necks. The forensic team at Nasser hospital are working with almost no resources to answer vast questions about torture, mistreatment and identity. The head of the unit, Dr Ahmed Dheir, said one of their biggest limitations is a lack of cold storage space. The bodies arrive in Gaza thoroughly frozen and can take several days to thaw out, ruling out even basic identification methods like dental history, let alone any deeper investigation or post-mortem (autopsy). ""The situation is extremely challenging,"" he said. ""If we wait for the bodies to thaw, rapid decomposition begins almost immediately, putting us in an impossible position [because] we lose the ability to examine the remains properly. So the most viable method is to take samples and document the state of the bodies as they are.""

Dr Ahmed Dheir says the lack of cold storage space means he and his colleagues have little time to examine the remains properly

The BBC has viewed dozens of photographs of the bodies, many of them shared by Gaza's health authorities, others taken by colleagues on the ground. We spoke to several of those involved in examining the bodies in Gaza, as well as families of the missing, human rights groups, and Israeli military and prison authorities. We also spoke to three forensic experts outside the region, including one specialising in torture, to educate ourselves about the medical processes involved in this kind of investigation – all agreed that there were questions that were difficult to answer without post-mortems. Dr Alaa al-Astal, one of the forensic team at Nasser hospital, said some of the bodies arriving there showed ""signs of torture"", such as bruises and marks from binding on the wrists and ankles. ""There were extremely horrific cases, where the restraint was so tight that blood circulation to the hands was cut off, leading to tissue damage and clear signs of pressure around the wrists and ankles,"" he said. ""Even around the eyes, when the blindfolds were removed, you could see deep grooves - imagine how much force that took. The pressure left actual marks where the blindfold had been tied."" Dr Astal also mentioned the loose cloths tied around the necks of some bodies as needing further investigation. ""In one case, there was a groove around the neck,"" he said. ""To determine whether the death was due to hanging or strangulation, we needed to perform a post-mortem, but because the body was frozen, it was not dissected.""

The bodies are bring brought to a temporary facility at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis

Sameh Yassin Hamad, a member of the Hamas-run government committee responsible for receiving the bodies, said there were signs of bruising and blood infiltration indicating that the bodies had been severely beaten before death. He also said there were stab wounds on the chest or face of some of them. Some of the images we saw from the unit clearly show deep indentations or tightly-fastened cable-ties on the wrists and arms and ankles. One photograph appears to show the bruising and abrasion that would confirm that ties had been used while the person was still alive. Other bodies showed only deep indentation marks, meaning a post-mortem would be needed to determine whether the ties had been used before or after death. Cable-ties are sometimes used when transporting bodies in Israel. When we asked Israel's military about the evidence we gathered, it said it operates strictly in accordance with international law. We showed the photographs we were given to the outside forensic experts. The images represent a fraction of the bodies transferred to Gaza by the Red Cross. All three experts said that some of the markings raised questions about what had happened, but that it was difficult to reach concrete conclusions about abuse or torture without post-mortems. ""What is happening in Gaza is an international forensic emergency,"" said Michael Pollanen, a forensic pathologist and professor at the University of Toronto. ""Based upon images like this, there is an imperative for complete medical autopsies. We need to know the truth behind how deaths occurred, and the only way to know the truth is to do autopsies."" But even with limited forensic data, doctors at Nasser hospital say the routine cuffing of wrists behind the body rather than in front, along with the marks observed on the limbs, points to torture. ""When a person is naked, with their hands tied behind their back, and visible restraint marks on their wrists and ankles, it indicates that they died in that position,"" Dr Dheir told us. ""This is a violation of international law."" And there is strong evidence to suggest widespread abuse of detainees - including civilians - in Israeli custody in the months after the war began in October 2023, particularly in the military facility of Sde Teiman.

Unidentified bodies are being buried in a mass grave once forensic exams have been carried out

""At least in the first eight months of the war, the detainees from Gaza were cuffed behind their backs, and had their eyes covered, 24 hrs, 7 days a week, for months,"" said Naji Abbas, head of the Prisoners and Detainees Programme at the Israeli human rights organisation, Physicians for Human Rights (PHRI). ""We know that people developed serious infections on their skin, hands and legs because of the cuffs."" We have spoken to several people who worked at Sde Teiman over the past two years, who confirm that detainees were cuffed hand and foot – even while undergoing medical treatments, including surgery. One medic who worked there said he had campaigned to loosen the cuffs, and that the treatment of detainees there was ""dehumanisation"". But many of those detained during the Gaza war are held as unlawful combatants, without charge. One complication for doctors at Nasser Hospital now is determining which of the returned bodies are Hamas fighters killed in combat, which are civilians and which are detainees who died in Israeli custody. Some of the bodies returned by Israel are still wearing Hamas headbands or military boots, but doctors say most are either naked or in civilian clothing, making it difficult to distinguish their role, interpret their injuries, and assess human rights violations. Photographs seen by the BBC show mostly naked or decomposed bodies. One dressed in civilian clothing and trainers has what officials say are two small bullet wounds in his back.

AFP Officials at Nasser hospital have been showing pictures of the bodies and any personal items to relatives of missing people

Sameh Yassin Hamad, from Gaza's Forensics Committee, said that Israel had sent back identification with only six of the 195 bodies it had returned – and that five of those names turned out to be wrong. ""Since these bodies were held by the Israeli authorities, they will have full data about them,"" said Dr Dheir. ""But they haven't shared that information with us through the Red Cross. We were sent DNA profiles for around half the total number of dead, but have not received any details about the dates or circumstances of death, or the time or place of detention."" We asked Israel's army about the details in this report, including striking allegations by Gaza's forensic team that Israel had removed single fingers and toes from the bodies for DNA testing. Israel's military said ""all bodies returned so far are combatants within the Gaza Strip."" It denied tying any bodies prior to their release. A spokeswoman for the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, Shosh Bedrosian, on Wednesday described the reports from Gaza as ""just more efforts to demonise Israel"" and suggested the media focus instead on the experience of Israeli hostages.

BBC Mum-of-four Afua Kyei says the Bank of England supports parents in the workplace

Afua Kyei, the Bank of England's chief financial officer, has been named the UK's most influential black person. The 43-year-old is one of the UK's most senior finance leaders, in charge of the financial governance of the Bank's £1 trillion balance sheet and funding reforms. The BoE executive director topped the 2026 Powerlist, which recognises the most powerful people of African, African Caribbean, and African American heritage in the UK. Other influential names include former footballer Ian Wright, who's new to the list, make-up artist Dame Pat McGrath and actor Idris Elba.

Kyei, who was recruited by the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in his former role as the governor of the Bank of England, said topping the list was ""incredibly humbling"". The mum-of-four said growing up she saw obvious differences in the workplace. She said: ""I didn't see so many women in big leadership roles who had families and I know that there are lots of women who think that they need to choose between work and having a family. ""What I love about the Bank of England is that we really support working families and working parents."" Kyei studied chemistry at Oxford University and was also awarded a junior research fellowship by Princeton University in organic chemistry.

'You don't need to be a mathematician'

During the global financial crisis, she was an investment banker before joining Barclays Bank where she was the Chief Financial Officer for Mortgages. She joined the Bank of England in 2019 and is at the core of the Bank's leadership and decision making. She said her parents, who moved to the UK from Ghana to go to university at 18, have been her biggest role models. ""My mother came to Liverpool, trained to become a midwife and enjoyed a 40-year plus career working for the NHS. ""My father has enjoyed a long career in the oil industry. I saw them juggling work and home. They instilled really strong values in us,"" she added. Kyei hopes to inspire more young people to consider banking as a career. ""You don't need to be a mathematician, you don't need to be an accountant and you don't need to be an economist. What we're looking for is fresh perspectives and we want the best people"". Kyei takes the place of tech CEO Dean Forbes at the head of the list.

https://www.theverge.com/tech/805652/intel-q3-2025-earnings-18a-panther-lake-ai-gpus-annual,"Intel’s tick-tock isn’t coming back, and everything else I just learned","Today on the company’s Q3 2025 earnings call, where Intel saw its first profit in nearly two years due primarily to those lifelines, CEO Lip-Bu Tan and CFO David Zinsner explained how the company doesn’t yet have enough chips. It’s currently seeing shortages that it expects to peak in the first quarter of next year — in the meantime, leaders say they’re going to prioritize AI server chips over some consumer processors as it deals with supply and demand.

“We expect CCG [Intel’s consumer chips] to be down modestly and DCAI [Intel’s server chips] to be up strongly as we prioritize capacity for server shipments over entry level client parts,” Intel says. Tan revealed today that Intel will also release new AI GPUs each and every year, following Nvidia and AMD in shaking up their traditional cadence to address the huge demand for AI servers. It’s not clear what that might mean for those hoping for more Intel gaming GPUs.

While all eyes are on Intel’s hot new Panther Lake and its 18A process to show the world it can still make the most potent consumer PC chips and make them in-house, the company reiterated it’s only launching one SKU of Panther Lake this year and slowly rolling out others in 2026. Here’s another possible reason why: Zinsner hinted today that Panther Lake will be a “pretty expensive” product to start with, and Intel’s going to have to push its existing Lunar Lake chips instead “in at least the first half of the year.”

While Intel has repeatedly pushed back against the idea that its 18A process had poor yields, the company admitted to investors and analysts today that it’s not ready to be a huge financial success either: yields are “adequate to address the supply but not where we need them to be to drive the appropriate level of margins,” says Zinsner, suggesting that it might be 2026, or even 2027 for an “acceptable level of yields” in that regard.

For now, Intel will be “working closely with customers to maximize our available output, including adjusting pricing and mix, to shift demand towards products where we have supply and they have demand” — which sounds like playing with the prices it charges PC makers to stick Intel inside their computers and pointing them at Lunar Lake parts instead of hot new ones. Tan reiterated today that he’s not going to invest in more capacity unless there’s “committed external demand,” and Zinsner says investments in capacity next year won’t “significantly change expectations”.

Intel says that 18A will be a “long-lived node” that will power “at least the next three generations of client and server products.” If you were hoping for a return to the “tick-tock” days where Intel would alternate between shrinking its chips and releasing new architectures every generation, that’s not happening here.

But that doesn’t mean Intel will cancel its next node, Intel 14A, as it warned it might. Tan suggested today that customers have stepped in to save 14A, and Intel, that the company is “delighted and more confident” in it, and Zinsner says it’s not only “off to a good start,” but better than 18A was at this point “in terms of performance and yields.”"
https://www.theverge.com/tech/652171/best-sonos-speakers,The best Sonos speakers to buy in 2025,"is a former senior reviewer who worked at The Verge from 2011 until May 2025. His coverage areas included audio, home theater, smartphones, and more.

Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.

After the self-induced tumult Sonos has gone through this year, I can understand why some people are reluctant to spend money on the company’s products. But newly appointed CEO Tom Conrad has shown that he’s determined to get back on track and revitalize Sonos as the leading whole-home audio brand. The contentious mobile app is in a much better place now than it was last year, though some customers still encounter bugs and the frustration of speakers randomly vanishing from their system. It’s not all roses, but the situation is moving in the right direction — and I took Sonos’ decision to cancel its video player as a promising sign of renewed focus.

I’m not about to sell any of my Sonos gear. For one, the company’s whole-home platform offers conveniences that competitors don’t match — at least not without hassle. Most of the time, I’m streaming from Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music. But if I’m watching a sports game on my TV, I can pipe the audio from my Sonos soundbar to a speaker in a different room to follow the action. Playing something over Bluetooth? With most of the company’s recent speakers, you can do the same thing and spread that music across your entire Sonos system.

Why you should trust my Sonos recommendations I’ve covered Sonos extensively for several years at The Verge. This has included reporting on the company’s latest news, reviewing a lengthy list of Sonos products, and bringing attention to the app fiasco, which eventually led to the ouster of former CEO Patrick Spence. Audio and home theater are two of my primary focus areas in product reviews, so I’m well-versed when it comes to determining whether a speaker or soundbar is great — or just another also-ran product.

I wouldn’t fault anyone for waiting to see where Sonos and its app go from here, especially given that Sonos recently raised prices on a number of products — including soundbars and smart speakers — due to the ongoing tariff situation in the US. The company still makes some genuinely terrific hardware, however, so if you’re wondering which are the true standouts, I’ve got you covered.

What I’m looking for How I test Sonos speakers Collapse I put in many hours testing Sonos’ various speakers and soundbars in their intended environments. That means listening to a product like the Move 2 both indoors and outside, having movie marathons to test the capabilities of Sonos soundbars, and spending the bulk of full days gauging the audio performance of speakers like the Five. With devices that are advertised as being water resistant, I’ll often bring them to lake getaways or use them near the pool to ensure that they can handle splashes and everyday elements. The right speaker for the right scenario Collapse Sonos has an extensive lineup of speakers spanning various form factors: there are desk speakers, portable Bluetooth speakers, soundbars, subwoofers, and, separate from all that, you have a few lingering Ikea Symfonisk products that are designed to blend into your home decor. The best pick will depend on what you need. Good sound quality Collapse Some “audiophiles” might turn their noses up at the idea that Sonos hardware can deliver excellent sound. But I think most people will be plenty happy with the audio quality. Even the company’s smaller products consistently deliver clear, pleasant audio. Adaptability Collapse Part of what makes the Sonos ecosystem so appealing is everything you can do with it. Want to play your TV’s audio in other rooms? You can do that. If you’ve got a Bluetooth-capable record player, the tiny Sonos Roam can play your vinyl and link that audio to the rest of your system. Line-in allows for the same at higher fidelity. Most importantly, the Sonos controller app supports practically every music streaming service on the market today. Lengthy software support Collapse Few tech companies continue to provide software updates and new features for their products as long as Sonos does. Speakers introduced a decade ago are still compatible with the company’s latest S2 platform and continue to receive firmware updates.

The best Sonos speaker to start with

If you’re looking for a decent-sounding, compact speaker to put in the kitchen, office, or really anywhere in your home, the Era 100 is your best option. Sonos improved upon this speaker’s predecessors, the Play:1 and Sonos One, by upgrading to stereo drivers for richer, wider audio. Bluetooth playback is now supported, along with line-in audio (with a separate dongle). And the Era 100 also has reworked physical controls, including a volume bar you can slide your finger across and, finally, dedicated track controls.

The Era 100’s built-in mics let you change the music when the physical controls are out of reach.

The speaker has an elegant design, and you can use hands-free voice controls to summon Amazon Alexa or Sonos Voice Control to skip tracks or switch to a different playlist. Sonos dropped the Era 100’s price to $199 in April and then raised it again in September, though we’d argue that $219 is still fair for what you’re getting.

The best overall Sonos speaker

The Sonos Five isn’t just Sonos’ best-sounding speaker; it’s at the top of the pack compared to all competitors. From an audio quality perspective, it beats the HomePod, Echo Studio, Nest Audio, and other mass market speakers — both those that are smart and not. Can you find better hi-fi bookshelf speakers? Absolutely, but those aren’t natively tied into music services like Sonos gear is. The Five is a hefty unit and takes up a decent amount of desk space. But once you throw some music on, its powerful stereo output is enough to handle any dinner party or weekend get-together.

There’s nothing “smart” about the Five. It lacks microphones and voice assistant functionality. But that simplicity is appealing in its own right: you’re getting a damn good speaker that ties into the Sonos platform. The Five also features a 3.5mm aux input, making it a good turntable companion — especially if you spring for a stereo pair.

The best portable Sonos speaker

When it comes to portable speakers, the Move 2 is in a whole different league than Sonos’ much smaller Roam 2. It’s bigger and heavier, but a built-in handle makes it easier to lug the Move 2 around your home or out to the backyard. There’s no comparison between the two when it comes to audio: the Move 2 smokes the far more compact Roam 2. And like the Era 100, it uses a stereo driver arrangement, whereas the Roam mixes everything down to mono and sounds more muffled.

The Move 2 is both water-resistant and drop-resistant, so it’s built for handling your outdoor parties.

The Move’s larger size gives it a clear advantage in terms of bass punch, and aside from playing music wirelessly, you’ve got the option of plugging in other devices over USB-C for line-in audio. I also continue to appreciate that the battery in the Move 2 is user-replaceable, which can’t be said of many Bluetooth speakers. You’ll be able to keep enjoying your investment for long, long into the future. And with a dust / water resistance rating of IP56, it can handle rain and splashes of water without problems; just don’t drop it into a pool.

I prefer the Move 2 over traditional portable speakers since, at least whenever I’m home, the Sonos lets me play music over Wi-Fi at a higher fidelity than Bluetooth can offer. Plus, the Move 2 also supports Apple AirPlay and Spotify Connect, so it’s easy to just skip the Sonos app altogether if you wish.

The best Sonos soundbar for home theater enthusiasts

Introduced in late 2024, the Arc Ultra improves on the original Arc with significantly more powerful bass response. That’s largely thanks to the inclusion of Sonos’ newer SoundMotion technology, which manages to get a better low-end wallop from a soundbar that’s not much larger than the model it replaces. This means some buyers can get away with buying the Arc Ultra on its own without adding a subwoofer.

That little indent makes it easier to find the Arc Ultra’s volume contrls.

The Arc Ultra delivers Dolby Atmos surround sound that’s more convincing and immersive than any other Sonos soundbar to date, and it’s up there with the very best you can find from a single-enclosure speaker. Vocal clarity has also improved substantially thanks to better center channel performance. Another upgrade over the first Arc is the addition of Bluetooth audio support.

The best Sonos soundbar for smaller rooms

There are plenty of scenarios and TV rooms where the Arc Ultra might be too powerful. If you’re in a smaller space or don’t need the absolute best surround sound, the Beam (Gen 2) starts to make more sense. It still has Atmos, but the effect is virtualized since the Beam lacks the Arc Ultra’s upward-firing speakers. Even so, the home theater experience you’ll get from the Beam will blow away any speakers built into a TV.

The best Sonos subwoofer for most people

In the same vein, unless you’re hell bent on rumbling your walls, the $499 Sub Mini subwoofer is more than enough for layering some extra oomph and growl onto Hollywood blockbusters and your favorite TV shows. The $899 Sub 4 is Sonos’ flagship subwoofer, but plenty of people have saved hundreds of dollars by pairing the Sub Mini with any of the company’s soundbars — and they’ve been ecstatic with the results.

How Mini is the Sub Mini? Smaller than most dogs.

As its name suggests, the Sub Mini is more compact than the Sub 4, which makes it easier to find an inconspicuous spot to place it. Even if you’re the type to do a sub crawl and put it somewhere in plain sight, I’d argue it looks more stylish than the blocky Sub 4.

The best budget Sonos speaker

Sonos and Ikea might have ended their partnership, but that doesn’t mean you should sleep on the existing Symfonisk products before they’re completely phased out. The Symfonisk Bookshelf Speaker (Gen 2), in particular, remains the most affordable gateway into the Sonos ecosystem, even with its recent price hike. Sound-wise, it’s not far off from the old Sonos One / Play:1 and is a very enjoyable speaker. Plus, the lower price tag makes it easier to convince yourself to scoop up two for a stereo pair. These — or the Symfonisk Picture Frame Speaker — make excellent rear surround speakers if you’re on a budget.

The Sonos product worthy of a second chance

Boy oh boy, did Sonos’ wireless headphones come right at the worst possible moment. The company’s app crisis completely sidelined the Ace headphones. Some customers were also disappointed that the Ace can’t play music over Wi-Fi or be grouped with the company’s in-home speakers.

But here’s the thing: the Ace headphones are still fantastic. They’re comfortable, have a gorgeous design (with easily swappable ear pads), and sound detailed, powerful, and expressive. They support wired audio over USB-C in addition to Bluetooth. And the TV Audio Swap feature is a useful perk that I still often use late at night when my Arc Ultra would disturb others. You can route any audio that would normally come through the soundbar — from your TV, gaming console, or streaming device — through two pairs of headphones and listen privately (with spatial audio surround sound). Sonos’ new TrueCinema mode even lets you fine-tune the latter to better reflect the acoustics of your space.

TV Audio Swap lets you privately listen to whatever’s coming out of your Sonos soundbar without disturbing others.

No, the Ace headphones aren’t what I’d consider the ideal of a wearable product from Sonos. But they remain a wholly impressive debut that fell victim to the company’s poor software decisions.

Microsoft is joining the AI browser wave with the official launch of a new “Copilot Mode” in Edge. The option, first announced in July, turns Copilot into your portal to the web, with each new tab opening a chat window where you can either ask a question, conduct a search, or enter a URL.

Copilot Mode ties Microsoft’s AI assistant more closely to Edge, as it combines AI-generated responses, search results, and navigation into one window. It also draws from all of your tabs — not just the one you’re on — allowing you to ask Copilot to summarize the information in all of your open windows or compare products in each one.

Though Microsoft previously launched Copilot Mode as an experimental feature, it’s now available for everyone to try, alongside a few new features available in a limited preview. That includes an agentic Copilot Actions feature that can do things like unsubscribe from marketing emails or book a reservation on your behalf.

Just like the other AI browsers out there, Copilot’s agentic features just aren’t totally reliable yet. Copilot displays a warning before taking action that says the tool is “intended for research and evaluation purposes” and “can make mistakes.” When I asked it to delete an email, for example, Copilot said it deleted it, but failed to actually do so. It also lied about sending an email that it composed directly in Gmail. The assistant did, however, successfully unsubscribe from a mailing list.

Outside of my email inbox, Copilot struggled to make a reservation for me at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City. I asked it to book a slot on November 26th, and even though it told me it selected a reservation for that date, the AI tool chose October 26th instead.

Copilot’s reservation was off by a month. Screenshot: The Verge

Copilot Mode in Edge can now use your browsing history to provide better responses — but only if you give it permission. Microsoft is launching Journeys in preview as well. Journeys is an AI-powered feature that organizes your browsing history into topics and makes suggestions about what to search for next. I didn’t browse enough using the new experience to see my own Journeys, but it seems like it might help you quickly dive back into a topic you frequently revisit.

You can turn on Copilot Mode by downloading Edge and toggling on the switch on Microsoft’s website. If you’re based in the US, you can also scroll down to enable Copilot Actions and Copilot Journeys in preview."

The race to make the Lego Game Boy play actual Game Boy games ended before it even began. The same day Lego officially launched the set, Natalie the Nerd revealed she’d already transformed it to play real Game Boy cartridges on real Game Boy chips.

Turns out she’s not stopping there! Natalie is now working on complete drop-in upgrade kits for the Lego Game Boy — no soldering required — and partnering with maker marketplace Crowd Supply to handle the logistics. She warns that this won’t be something you’ll want to play every day, but she’s still making it real.

She’s calling her kit the Build A Boy, and she says the completely pre-soldered version should truly be “drop in and play.” It’s her custom-designed board with everything you should need beyond the bricks, including:

an actual harvested Game Boy Pocket CPU

a 2.7-inch 320 x 320 display

working switches you can place behind your Lego buttons and D-pad for actual controls

a speaker and a volume wheel

a rechargeable battery

a USB-C port to charge it

Natalie confirms to The Verge that she’s planning to offer an optional glass lens if you hate the plastic window that Lego uses to cover the screen — and she might even offer some sort of video output so you can play on a TV or other external screen, though it’s not guaranteed. She’s not sure how she’ll make video out happen yet, though. “It could even be potentially be over Wi-Fi if that doesn’t affect performance,” she tells me.

While the original Game Boy offered a 160 x 144 10:9 aspect ratio display, Natalie says the 320 x 320 one will simply upscale the original images by 2x while keeping their relative shape and size the same.

Natalie doesn’t plan to wire up a Link Cable port for multiplayer play — “I don’t personally care for the link port,” she tells me — but says she’ll “probably” leave a pinout so modders can add their own.

As far as harvesting the chips goes, Natalie says she’s managed to buy damaged Game Boy Pockets in bulk, as they’re the “unloved sibling” of the Game Boy family, but she doubts she’ll have enough to satisfy demand. If you have a donor Game Boy Pocket yourself, she’ll also sell a version that only requires the CPU and RAM for around $60. She’ll also sell a completely DIY version for the “soldering iron pros” out there. She’ll also still release files for free.

It’s not clear what the entire drop-in kit will cost yet, given Trump’s tariffs. “I am aiming for $99 USD but y’know how the world is at the moment,” she writes. She’s hoping to start selling them in early 2026, and says she should receive the first test boards this very week.

Natalie’s kit won’t be the only way to play a Lego Game Boy for real. For example, tap the video below!

While it’s quite a feat to shrink an entire actual working Game Boy down to the size of a Game Boy cartridge, others are coming close — modder Hairo Satoh has been showing off an excellent Game Boy Color version on Instagram that uses real cartridges, though he tells me it required a lot of modification to the Lego “shell” and he’s not sure he’ll release a kit himself. Generally, Satoh sells one-offs on commission.

Meanwhile, the rival BrickBoy kit might be the easiest and most sustainable way to power a Lego Game Boy yet. It plays ROMs on an emulator, not actual cartridges on actual chips, which defeats some of the fun for me — but at least no Game Boy Pockets will be harmed in the making of that kit. We’re still waiting to share how much it’ll cost; it’ll launch on Kickstarter on October 28th."

Nike is showing off new performance apparel today that it says it designed with climate change in mind. It introduced its new Aero-FIT performance cooling technology, which it says will make its debut in football kits Nike federations wear in 2026.

The company claims the technology boosts sweating efficiency by allowing for more air movement between skin and fabric. In contrast, stuffy uniforms can impede the body’s ability to cool itself down when sweat evaporates from skin. Aero-FIT will allow for more than double the airflow compared to the brand’s existing athletic apparel, Nike says. The new material also be made entirely from textile waste, which addresses another climate problem since synthetic fabrics are made from fossil fuels.

The next FIFA World Cup takes place in 2026, and already there are concerns about the risks that heat exhaustion could pose to athletes and fans in the audience. Games will be held during the summertime across Mexico, Canada, and the US. Of the 16 cities hosting games, 14 are expected to be susceptible to extreme heat during the World Cup, the BBC reports.

“Today’s athletes are competing in a hotter, wetter world — and Nike is helping them set the pace,” Nike’s announcement today says."
