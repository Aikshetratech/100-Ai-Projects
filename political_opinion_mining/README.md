Opinion Mining for Political Elections

The Opinion Mining for Political Elections project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Sentiment Analysis to analyze public opinions about political parties, leaders, or topics based on social media posts, news articles, or user comments.

It helps researchers and analysts identify voter sentiment, popular issues, and trends leading up to or during election campaigns.

🧠 How It Works

1️⃣ Data Collection:
Tweets or online posts are collected using snscrape, tweepy, or API data.

2️⃣ Preprocessing:
Text is cleaned — punctuation, URLs, emojis, and mentions are removed.

3️⃣ Sentiment Analysis:
Each post is classified as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using an NLP model (TextBlob, VADER, or fine-tuned BERT).

4️⃣ Entity Recognition:
Detects mentions of political parties, leaders, or campaign topics.

5️⃣ Visualization:
Results are displayed as pie charts, bar graphs, and word clouds.

📊 Example Output
Text	Candidate	Sentiment	Polarity Score
“I think the new education policy is excellent.”	Party A	Positive	0.76
“Too many promises, not enough results.”	Party B	Negative	-0.43
“The debate was okay, nothing special.”	Neutral	0.05
