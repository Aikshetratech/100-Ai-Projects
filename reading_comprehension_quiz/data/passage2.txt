The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. This cycle is driven by the energy of the sun, which causes water from oceans, rivers, and lakes to evaporate into the atmosphere. Plants also contribute through a process called transpiration, releasing water vapor from their leaves.

Once in the atmosphere, water vapor cools and condenses to form clouds. These clouds eventually release water as precipitation, which can be in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail. The precipitation replenishes water bodies, infiltrates into the soil, and may even contribute to underground aquifers.

The water cycle is vital for maintaining life on Earth. It distributes fresh water to ecosystems, regulates climate, and supports agriculture. Disruptions in this cycle, caused by climate change or deforestation, can lead to droughts, floods, and water scarcity, emphasizing the importance of preserving this natural process.
