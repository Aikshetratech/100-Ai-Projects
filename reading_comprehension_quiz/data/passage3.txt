Internet safety is the practice of protecting your personal information, devices, and online interactions from cyber threats. With the increasing use of the internet for communication, education, and commerce, the risk of encountering malware, phishing attacks, identity theft, and cyberbullying has grown significantly.

To stay safe online, users should create strong, unique passwords and change them regularly. Avoiding the sharing of sensitive information such as bank details or passwords on untrusted websites is crucial. Using secure networks, enabling two-factor authentication, and keeping software up to date are additional protective measures.

Education and awareness are also important. Parents and teachers should guide children about appropriate online behavior and the dangers of interacting with strangers online. Practicing good internet hygiene helps protect privacy, ensures security, and builds a safer online environment for everyone.
